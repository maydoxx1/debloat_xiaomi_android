# Xiaomi Debloater 🚫📱

A simple, no-bullshit shell script to debloat MIUI-based Hyper OS-based Xiaomi devices via ADB. Removes spyware, adware, and system bloat safely — without root.

## 🔧 Requirements

- ADB (Android Platform Tools)
- Xiaomi device with USB debugging enabled
- Linux, macOS, or Windows

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
chmod +x debloat.sh
./debloat.sh
```
# Nix OS and distros who uses portable bash
```bash
chmod +x debloat_portable.sh
./debloat_portable.sh
```
# For Windows
Download the bat and sit back ^_^

# ⚠️ Disclaimer
This script is safe for most users, but back up your device first.

You can re-enable apps via Xiaomi's App Store or factory reset if needed.

Tested on multiple MIUI / HyperOS builds, but use at your own risk.
